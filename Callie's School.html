        <p>This was the school that I use to go to. The school I use to go to is called Boston Latin Academy. This school was built a long time ago so that is why it looks so old. In this school there were many clubs and sports you can join. Their school mascot was a dragon. I began this school when I was in 7th grade and  I had met a lot of new friends their. Everyone there was really nice and I am sad to be leaving them.</p>

        <p>This is the new school that I will be going to. It is also built a long time ago. I have some friends that I already know so I'm not as nervous going to a new school. The mascot of this school is a wolf.</p>
