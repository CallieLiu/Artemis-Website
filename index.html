    <p>Hi, I'm Callie. I'm on the left and my brother is on the right. I am 13 and going to high school. I like to do many activites for fun. Although I like to do many things on my free time, I usually don't have much free time. Most of my time I am either doing homework or going to school. During the weekdays during school I usually go to school. On Saturdays, I go to art class and on Sundays, I used to go to Chinese school. Now in the summer I go to Artemis on the weekdays and on the weekends I go to Art school and a Reading class. </p>
