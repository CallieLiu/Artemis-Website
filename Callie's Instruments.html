        <p>I play the violin. The violin has higher pitches then the viola, cello, and bass. I usually play the violin a orchestra. That means that I play the violin with the viola, cello, bass, and other stringed instruments. Some people can't tell the difference between the violin and viola. The viola is bigger than the violin and it has a deeper sound too.</p>
